A C++ utility for converting character strings to integers, leveraging Windows-specific functionality (e.g., `RtlCharToInteger`). This project is designed for **developers**, **Windows internals enthusiasts**, and **security researchers** to explore string-to-integer conversion in a Windows environment. Ideal for learning about Windows API or kernel-level programming.

---

## Overview

`RtlCharToInteger` is a lightweight C++ tool that demonstrates the conversion of character strings to integer values, likely using the Windows `RtlCharToInteger` function or similar mechanisms. The project serves as an **educational resource** for understanding Windows runtime library (RTL) functions and their applications in user-mode or kernel-mode programming.

> **⚠️ Note**: This tool is for educational purposes only. Ensure you understand the code and its implications before use.
